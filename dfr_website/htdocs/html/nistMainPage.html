				<p id="dfrIntro">NIST has compiled a set of standards for deleted file recovery tools that can be used to evaluate the correctness and performance of these tools. A set of hands-on lab activities to evaluate the DFR tools are available here. The labs can be readily incorporated in a Digital Forensics curriculum.</p>
				<p id="hwbIntro">A hands-on activity to evaluate hardware write blocker (HWB) is created which can be readily incorporated into a Digital Forensics curricula. The NIST CFTT system is used to evaluate a HWB. A sample set of test results is available here, which can be reproduced or compared with.</p>
