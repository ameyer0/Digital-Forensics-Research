% We present a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape of Android malware.
% To help the research community better understand malware behavior
% and design new anti-virus solutions,
We created a large volume of well-labeled and well-studied
Android malware dataset containing \samsize samples, categorized in \versize
varieties among \fsize families ranging from 2010 to 2016.
For each variety of this dataset we 
conduct a comprehensive study to profile their behaviors and evolution trends.
We document in details the process of creating this dataset to enable other
researchers to replicate the process.
We observe that Android malware are evolving towards monetization, and becoming
sophisticated and persistent.
The extensive usage of anti-analysis techniques in the malware samples
shows the urgent need for advanced de-obfuscation and dynamic analysis methods.
We will make the dataset available to research community.
