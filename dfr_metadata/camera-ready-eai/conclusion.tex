\section{Conclusion}

We designed a set of canonical test cases to determine a metadata-based DFR tool's meeting with the NIST CFTT guidelines.
We tested five popular DFR tools and evaluated their results.
We presented a comparison of the tools based on the number of test cases for which each tool meets the standards.
We concluded that none of the tested tools consistently fulfilled the NIST guidelines, and explain the factors which cause them to fail.
We also identified potential weaknesses in the guidelines and suggested improvements.
