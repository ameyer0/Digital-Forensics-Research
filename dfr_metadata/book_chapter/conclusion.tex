\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion} 

We evaluated deleted file recovery (DFR) tools according to guidelines set by NIST CFTT.
We used test cases provided by CFTT to evaluate file carving tools, and designed our own test cases to evaluate metadata-based DFR tools.
We analyzed the results of these tests to determine how well each tool meets the guidelines and how they compare on various tasks.
We also critiqued the CFTT guidelines based on our experiments and analysis.
