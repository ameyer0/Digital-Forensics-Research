\section{Research Questions} \label{rqs}

DFR tools, which come in both metadata-based and file carving variants, are software for recovering deleted data from a digital storage device.
We evaluate a selection of DFR tools according to guidelines set by NIST CFTT.
We specifically investigate the following research questions (RQs):

\begin{itemize}
\item[RQ1.] How well do our selected metadata-based DFR tools meet each of the NIST CFTT guidelines?

\item[RQ2.] What conditions influence the success and failure of metadata-based DFR tools?

\item[RQ3.] How well do our selected file carving tools meet each of the NIST CFTT guidelines?

\item[RQ4.] What conditions influence the success and failure of file carving tools?
\end{itemize}
