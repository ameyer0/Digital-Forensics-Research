% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'

%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you

\begin{abstract}
Digital forensics (DF) tools are used for post-mortem investigation of cyber-crimes and cyber-attacks. 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
has set standards for DF tools. Compliance of the standards by the DF tools is critical, especially in judical proceedings. 
In this paper we consider standardization of one class of DF tools that are for Deleted File Recovery (DFR). 
Our experiments with a popular tool-suite (named Autopsy) show that it does not satisfy some of the standards for DFR. 
Furthermore, we evaluate other frequently-used DFR tools on the same standards, and report the findings.  
We compile a comparative analysis of these tools' performance, which could help the user choose the right DFR tool. 
%We hope our findings will trigger more research activities on compliance of standards from the researcher community as well as the practitioners.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Metadata-Based Deleted File Recovery}

\subsection{FAT Filesystem}

\subsection{NTFS Filesystem}

\subsection{NIST Standards}
\begin{enumerate} % TODO cite standards document
 \item ``The tool shall identify all deleted File System-Object entries accessible in residual metadata.''
 \item ``The tool shall construct a Recovered Object for each deleted File System-Object entry accessible in residual metadata.''
 We consider a tool passing this standard as long as it outputs a file for each deleted file, even if the output file is empty.
 \item ``Each Recovered Object shall include all non-allocated data blocks identified in a residual metadata entry.'' For FAT filesystems, we consider a tool passing this standard if it recovers at least the first contiguous segment of unallocated sectors starting from the first sector originally allocated to the deleted file. For NTFS filesystem, the tool must recover all unallocated sectors originally allocated to the deleted file.
 \item ``Each Recovered Object shall consist only of data blocks from the Deleted Block Pool.''
 We consider a tool passing this standard if all recovered sectors were all originally allocated to the deleted file, and had not been reallocated to any other file.

\section{Conclusion}

%Papers should be no more than ten pages, single- spaced, with 12pt font
%for the text content. Left, right, top and bottom margins need to be 1''.  Pages
%should not be numbered (they will be numbered for the proceedings). The title
%and author information are single-column centered at the top of the first page.   
%
%The remaining document should be double- column format. Please give an address
%and email address for each author of the paper. Sections (if used) should be
%numbered and titled. Figures, tables, and other diagrams should be numbered and
%titled. Please try to include each figure near the text it addresses. If
%necessary, you may elect to place large figures at the end of your paper using
%the full width of the page (single-column format). 
%
%Follow the rules of accepted grammar and mathematical formatting. Remember that
%the quality of your paper is one of the criteria for judgment. 

%\subsection{References}
%Use the standard CACM format for references -- that is, a numbered list at the
%end of the article, ordered alphabetically by first author, and referenced by
%numbers in brackets~\cite{bowman:reasoning}.  The references are also in 12pt,
%but that section is ragged right.  Other references that may prove helpful
%include~\cite{Dupre:1995:BW,Lamport:LaTeX,Mittelbach:2004:LC}.
%
%\subsection{Page Number, Headers and Footers}
%Do not include headers, footers, or page numbers in your submission.  These will
%be added when the proceedings are assembled.

%%% To balance the columns, we need this to be in the code for the LEFT column
% on the last page
