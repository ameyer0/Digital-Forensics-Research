\section{Conclusion}

We designed an exhaustive set of canonical test cases to determine a metadata-based DFR tool's compliance with the NIST CFTT standards.
We tested five popular DFR tools and evaluated their results.
We presented a comparison of the tools based on the number of test cases for which each tool meets the standards.
We concluded that none of the tested tools consistently fulfilled the NIST standards, and explain the factors which cause them to fail.
We also identified potential weaknesses in the standards and suggested improvements.
